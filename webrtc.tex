\chapter{WebRTC example applications}
In this chapter we'll show some example applications and implementations. These are in a minified version and do not necessarily represent the best practices that should be applied. Nevertheless, there will be sources provided where those best practices can be deducted.

\subsubsection{Access media}
Then when we have checked if the API's is present we can access client medias, given the user has given his consent.

First we'll add a video channel so the user can see the input from the camera.
