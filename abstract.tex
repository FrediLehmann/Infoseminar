\index{WebRTC}{WebRTC} is a web \index{API}{API} for real-time communication on a peer-to-peer basis. It's implemented by browsers and made available for web developers through dedicated interfaces. Like all standards, the \index{WebRTC}{WebRTC} standard changes over time to cover new use cases, remove unused or deprecated use cases. There are some moving parts involved in the way the \index{API}{API} is used which one needs to be aware of before using the \index{API}{API}. In this paper we will explore the state of \index{WebRTC}{WebRTC} and some of its use cases.
