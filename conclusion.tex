\subsection{\index{STUN}{STUN} / \index{TURN}{TURN} Server}
To not be dependent from open \index{STUN}{STUN}{}/\index{TURN}{TURN}{TURN} servers one can deploy his own servers. There are open source projects covering this case. For example coturn~\cite{coturn}.

\subsection{\index{Videobridge}{Videobridge}}
Video conferencing can be a resource intensive task for a browser. Which leads it to be a solution that is not really scalable. \index{Videobridge}{Videobridge} can help tackle this issue. The \index{Jitsi}{Jitsi} \index{Videobridge}{videobridge} is an open source example of such a \index{Videobridge}{videobridge}. It is used to implement scalable video conferencing platforms. It is an Selective Forwarding Unit (SFU) which relays video streams between peers.
