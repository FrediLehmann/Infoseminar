\subsection{\index{stun}{} / \index{turn}{} Server}
To not be dependent from open \index{stun}{}/\index{turn}{} servers one can deploy his own servers. There are open source projects covering this case. For example coturn \cite{coturn}.

\subsection{Videobridge}
Video conferencing can be a resource intensive task for a browser. Which leads it to be a solution that is not really scalable. Videobridges can help tackle this issue. The Jitsi videobridge is an open source example of such a videobridge. It is used to implement scalable video conferencing platforms. It is an Selective Forwarding Unit (SFU) which relays video streams between peers.
