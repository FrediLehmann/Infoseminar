\chapter{Outlook}
In a further project one could take a look on a more complete solution. How would the architecture of a fully working video conferencing application look, how's the signaling implemented, for example with socket.io~\autocite{socketio}, what are we using as \index{STUN}{STUN}/\index{TURN}{TURN} servers etc.. I think it would be quite interesting to see a complete solution to a conferencing tool.
