\chapter{Introduction}
WebRTC is short for web real-time communication, it is an API that modern browser support and can be used by web developers to implement a peer to peer communication. It can be used to capture and stream audio and/or video data, as well as to exchange arbitrary data between browser without requiring an intermediary.

\section{Support}
All major browser support WebRTC in its newest release. Older versions might not, or only partialy, implement this API so the Adapter.js~\autocite{adapterjs} project should be considered for productive solutions. For detailed information on supported browsers use caniuse~\autocite{caniuse}.
