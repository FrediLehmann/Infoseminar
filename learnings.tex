\subsection{STUN / TURN Server}
To not be dependent from open STUN/TURN servers one can deploy his own servers. There are open source projects covering this case. For example coturn \cite{coturn}.

\subsection{Jitsi Videobridge}
Video conferencing can be a resource intensive task for a browser. Which leads it to be a solution that is not really scalable. This is where Jitsi comes to the rescue. Jitsi Videobridge is an open source lightweight video conferencing server. It is used to implement scalable video conferencing platforms. It is an Selective Forwarding Unit (SFU) which relays video streams between peers.
